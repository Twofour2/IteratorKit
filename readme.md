# Iterator Kit

Iterator kit is a mod for rainworld that allows for easier building of new iterators and custom iterator dialogs.

**Features**
- Customizable colors, gowns and sigils
- Events system for running actions and dialogs
- Item/Pearl dialogs
- Override dialogs/events for specific slugcats. I.e. custom slugs
- Create custom pearls with unique dialogs for each iterator

**Verify**  
Before filing an issue, please verify you have the mod correctly installed.

1. Open the dev tools with "o" and change to the objects tab  
2. Change the "OBJECTS" window to the "Consumable" page  
3. Spawn a data pearl  
4. Change it from "misc" to "tomato". This may take a while of clicking as it's at the end of the list.  
5. If you see the pearl the mod it correctly installed and loaded.  

**Todo**
- Pearl effects
- Neuron Flies
- Iterator halos
- Destroyed/sitting iterators  
- Better support for calling custom code
