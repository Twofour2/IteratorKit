# Iterator Kit

Iterator kit is a mod for rainworld that allows for easier building of new iterators and custom iterator dialogs.

**heads up:** I'm not really working on this mod for the time being aside from some small support updates. It's buggy AF due to how complex iterators are and stopped being interesting for me to want to work on. 
If you wish to improve Iterator Kit and fix issues with it, [fork it](https://github.com/Twofour2/IteratorKit/fork), make your changes, and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Twofour2/IteratorKit/pulls).  
If someone wishes to take over, please DM me on discord.  

**Features**
- Customizable colors, gowns, halos and sigils
- Events system for running actions and dialogs
- Item/Pearl dialogs
- Override dialogs/events for specific slugcats. I.e. custom slugs
- Creature detection for joke dialogs 
- Create custom pearls with unique dialogs for each iterator

**Verify**  
Before filing an issue, please verify you have the mod correctly installed.

1. Open the dev tools with "o" and change to the objects tab  
2. Change the "OBJECTS" window to the "Consumable" page  
3. Spawn a data pearl  
4. Change it from "misc" to "tomato". This may take a while of clicking as it's at the end of the list.  
5. If you see the pearl the mod it correctly installed and loaded.  

**Todo**
- More advanced oracle room effects
